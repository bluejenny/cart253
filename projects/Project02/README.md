# Project 2 - Anything - CART 253

This is meant to be the opposite of doom scrolling.

An endless simulation that takes
you away to another place until such
time you decide to return to your reality.
Rewards for precision and focus. Also a digital clock.

I wanted to create something fun and functional
that allowed me explore inheritace and other
coding concepts from the course, plus keep me distracted
from the ever present doom of our reality.
