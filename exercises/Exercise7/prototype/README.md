# Project 1 : Simulation

Sundogs often form in pairs on either side of the sun when sunlight refracts through icy clouds containing hexagonal crystals. They can occur during all seasons, but they are most common during winter months when ice crystals are more abundant. Sundogs are best seen when the sun is near the horizon. Despite their beauty, sundogs are a sign of bad weather to come.

Seeing the sundog is the goal & reward of this simulalation.
